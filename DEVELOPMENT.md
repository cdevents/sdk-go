## Setting up a development environment

### Setup a GitHub account accessible via SSH

GitHub is used for project Source Code Management (SCM) using the SSH protocol for authentication.

1. Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one.
1. Setup
[GitHub access via SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)

### Install tools

You must install these tools:

1. [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): For source control

1. [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install): The language this SDK is built in.
    > **Note** Golang [version v1.23](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher is required.

1. [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): not stricly required but handy to run
   tests with a single command.

### Setup a fork

The sdk-go project requires that you develop (commit) code changes to branches that belong to a fork of the `cdevents/sdk-go` repository in your GitHub account before submitting them as Pull Requests (PRs) to the actual project repository.

1. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the `cdevents/sdk-go` repository in your GitHub account.

1. Create a clone of your fork on your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/sdk-go.git
    ```

1. Configure `git` remote repositories

    Adding `cdevents/sdk-go` as the `upstream` and your fork as the `origin` remote repositories to your `.git/config` sets you up nicely for regularly [syncing your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and submitting pull requests.

    1. Change into the project directory

        ```shell
        cd sdk-go
        ```

    1. Configure sdk-go as the `upstream` repository

        ```shell
        git remote add upstream git@github.com:cdevents/sdk-go.git

        # Optional: Prevent accidental pushing of commits by changing the upstream URL to `no_push`
        git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
        ```

    1. Configure your fork as the `origin` repository

        ```shell
        git remote add origin git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/sdk-go.git
        ```

## Developing, building and testing

Make target all defined to run unit tests, format imports, format go code and run the linter.

To format the go code and imports:

```shell
$ make fmt
```

To run the go linter:

```shell
$ make lint
```

To run unit tests:
```shell
$ make test
```

To run all targets, before creating a commit:

```shell
make all
```
